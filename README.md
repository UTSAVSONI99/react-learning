#Description

"I have hands-on experience in React and have built projects like a Weather Data app, Currency Converter, and Password Generator. Through these projects, I have gained a strong understanding of key React concepts such as API fetching, state management, props, and React Router. I am continuously exploring advanced features to enhance my development skills and build more dynamic web applications."
